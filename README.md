 # Travelable
### A web based application designed to provide relevant information on Covid-19 restrictions when travelling between US states.
This is **Travelable**.
Using our service, you can find out which restrictions US states have introduced, and how they differ between states. The service takes into account restrictions such as the openness of the state, the need to be vaccinated, whether cafes and restaurants are open, whether you need to quarantine etc. It is important that the information displayed in this service is up-to-date, and that the user can be confident in its accuracy. The service collects data from government websites that contain data on the availability of a particular state to visit, and displays this data on a map. You can also enter a specific state in the search and the service will display information on the restrictions in the selected state.
Designed and developed as part of the ***Practicum by Yandex*** International Code Jam, October 2021.
